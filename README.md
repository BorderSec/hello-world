# Hello-world

Intro

My name is Robert Border and I'm currently a student at DePaul University majoring in Information Assurance and Security Engineering. I have a lot of experience on the networking side of things and now starting the process of moving over to the security side.

Background

After high school I went straight into the Marine Corps, which was probably the best decision I could've made at the time. It gave me the opportunity to learn a lot about computer networking and allowed me to gain experience in real world IT environments. Most importantly, it gave me the drive and perseverance to overcome obstacles and to succeed in any situation.

Goals

The main focus of this site will be to document my activities related to the cyber security field. I spend a lot of my free time setting up different types of servers and then breaking them, so I'm hoping this can be a place for people beginning in their career to learn something new/interesting. Worst case scenario it will be a place where I can document my projects as I learn, and provide a place to refer back to at a later time.
